# Patient Management System

## Overview
This Patient Management System is build to manage patient queues in a hospital. The system allows for adding new patients, processing the next patient, updating patient priority, and displaying all patients in the queue. 

## Features
- **Add New Patients:** Input patient details including name, gender, SSN, date of birth, and a task (e.g., surgery, X-ray scan).
- **Process Patients:** Processes patients based on their priority and arrival time.
- **Update Patient Priority:** Change a patient's priority, which automatically updates their assigned task.
- **Display All Patients:** View all patients currently in the queue with details including name, gender, DOB, SSN, task, priority, and the timestamp of when they were added to the queue.
- **Duplicate SSN Check:** Ensures that no two patients have the same SSN in the system.

## Using the System
The program operates in a menu-driven manner. Here are the options you will see:

1. **Add New Patient** - Follow the prompts to enter patient details.
2. **Process Next Patient** - Automatically selects and processes the patient with the highest priority.
3. **Update Patient Priority** - Enter the SSN of the patient to update and follow prompts to change their priority and task.
4. **Display All Patients** - Lists all the patients currently in the queue.
5. **Exit** - Closes the application.
